## 3D Printing Workshop for Beginners

### Workshop Structure (2 hours total)

**Part 1: Introduction (20 minutes)**
- Workshop overview and goals
- Brief history of 3D printing (mention key developments like stereolithography)
- Main strengths of 3D printing: geometric complexity, nested parts, reduced waste
- Show some inspiring examples of 3D printed objects (clock, microscope, etc.)

**Part 2: 3D Printing Technologies (20 minutes)**
- Focus primarily on FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) as it's most accessible
- Brief overview of other technologies (SLA, SLS, etc.)
- Common materials for beginners (PLA as office-friendly and easy to print)
- Safety considerations (ventilation, particle emissions)

**Part 3: Design Rules for 3D Printing (30 minutes)**
- Overhangs and support structures (the 45-degree rule)
- Bridging capabilities
- Wall thickness minimums
- Clearances for moving parts
- Print orientation and layer strength (anisotropic properties)
- Infill patterns and density
- Avoiding sharp corners

**Part 4: From Design to Print (20 minutes)**
- Common file formats (focus on STL)
- Slicer software overview (Cura or PrusaSlicer)
- Key slicer settings for beginners
  - Layer height
  - Infill percentage
  - Print speed
  - Bed adhesion (brims, rafts)

**Part 5: Hands-on Activity (30 minutes)**
- Design challenge: Create a simple object with features that would be difficult/impossible to make subtractively
- Guide participants through a simplified design process

### End Activity: "Design for 3D Printing Challenge"

**Objective:** Create a simple keychain or small container that demonstrates at least one 3D printing-specific capability.

**Options:**
1. **Nested Keychain:** A keychain with a freely moving internal part (like a ball in a cage or spinning gear)
2. **Interlocking Container:** A small box with a snap-fit or interlocking lid
3. **Bridged Name Tag:** A name tag or sign with letters that "float" using bridging principles

**Process:**
1. Provide participants with a simple template in TinkerCAD or similar beginner-friendly software
2. Walk them through adding one feature that demonstrates a unique 3D printing capability
3. Have them export the STL file
4. Demonstrate slicing the design with proper settings
5. Either print a few examples during the workshop (if time permits) or arrange for printing after the workshop

**Takeaways:**
- Each participant leaves with a design file ready for printing
- They understand at least one key design principle specific to 3D printing
- They've experienced the complete workflow from design to print-ready file

### Additional Workshop Tips:

1. **Visual Aids:** Bring physical examples of successful and failed prints to demonstrate concepts
2. **Handout:** Provide a simple reference sheet with design rules and common terms
3. **Follow-up:** Offer resources for continued learning (online tutorials, local makerspaces)
4. **Safety:** Emphasize proper ventilation and material handling

This workshop structure gives beginners a solid foundation in 3D printing concepts while keeping the content accessible and engaging with a hands-on component. The end activity reinforces key learnings through practical application.
